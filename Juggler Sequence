Juggler Sequence is a series of integers in which the first term starts with a positive integer number a and the remaining terms are generated from the immediate previous term using the below recurrence relation:

 a_(k+1)={|_a_k^(1/2)_|   for even a_k; |_a_k^(3/2)_|   for odd a_k, 

Given a number N, find the Juggler Sequence for this number as the first term of the sequence.


Example 1:

Input: N = 9
Output: 9 27 140 11 36 6 2 1
Explaination: We start with 9 and use 
above formula to get next terms.
 

Example 2:

Input: N = 6
Output: 6 2 1
Explaination: 
61/2 = 2. 
21/2 = 1.
 

Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your Task is to complete the function jugglerSequence() which takes N as input parameter and returns a list of integers denoting the generated sequence.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

 

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
