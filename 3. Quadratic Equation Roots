3. Quadratic Equation Roots 

.............................

Given a quadratic equation in the form ax2 + bx + c. Find its roots.

Note: Return the maximum root followed by the minimum root.

Example 1:

Input:
a = 1
b = -2
c = 1
Output: 1 1
Explanation:
Roots of equation x2-2x+1 are 1 and 1.

Example 2:

Input:
a = 1
b = -7
c = 12
Output: 4 3
Explanation: Roots of equation 
x2 - 7x + 12 are 4 and 3.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function quadraticRoots() which takes a, b, c as input parameters and returns a list of two integers containing the floor value of its roots in decreasing order. If roots are imaginary, the returning list should contain only 1 integer ie -1. Always return the greatest integer smaller than or equal to the result.
Note: If roots are imaginary, the generated output will display "Imaginary".

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space : O(1)

 

Constraints:
-103 <= a,b,c <= 103

        vector<int> v;
       int q=(b*b)-(4*a*c),s,t;
       if(q<0)
       {
           v.push_back(-1);
           return v;
       }
       s=floor((-b+(sqrt(q)))/(2*a));
       t=floor((-b-(sqrt(q)))/(2*a));
       if(s>=t) 
       {   v.push_back(s);
           v.push_back(t);
       }
       else
       {
           v.push_back(t);
           v.push_back(s);
       }
       
       return v;
   
    }
