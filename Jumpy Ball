Jumpy Ball

...........................

You have a jumpy ball. You throw it up from the ground up to a height of H. The ball is jumpy, so when it comes back to the ground, it rebounds and goes up again to a distance of floor(H/2). This keeps on repeating until it can't rebound anymore. You need to find the total distance traveled by the ball.

Example 1:

Input:
H = 10

Output:
36

Explanation:
H is 10. From ground to H it travels d=10.
From H to ground it travels d=10+10. Now H
becomes floor(10/2). So ball rebounds to d=10+10+5.
It goes down to the ground. d=10+10+5+5. Now H
becomes floor(5/2). So ball rebounds to d=10+10+5+5+2.
The ball goes down. d=10+10+5+5+2+2. H becomes
floor(2/2). So ball rebounds to d=10+10+5+5+2+2+1.
It goes down to the ground. d=10+10+5+5+2+2+1+1.
H becomes floor(1/2). H is zero so no rebound.
Total d=36.
Example 2:

Input:
H = 20

Output:
76
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function jumpyBall() which takes an integer H as an input parameter and returns the total distance traveled by the ball.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log H)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
0 <= H <= 1015
