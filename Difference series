Difference series 

...............
Given a series of numbers  3,10,21,36 …., and series starting from N = 1, find the pattern and output the N'th value of the above series.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 1
Output:
3
Explanation:
3 is the first term of the series.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 2
Output:
10
Explanation:
10 is the second term of the series.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function differenceSeries() which takes an integer N as input parameter and returns the N'th term of the series.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 100

................

  int differenceSeries(int N)
    {
        // Write Your Code here
        int first = 0;
       int firstTerm = 3;
       int NthTerm = 3;
       if(N==1){
           return 3;
       }
       while(N!=1){
           NthTerm = (NthTerm) + (firstTerm-first+4);
           first = firstTerm;
           firstTerm = NthTerm;
           N--;
       }
       return NthTerm;
    }
};
