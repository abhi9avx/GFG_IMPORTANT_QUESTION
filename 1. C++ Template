1. C++ Template 

...............

Template in C++ is a feature. We write code once and use it for any data type including user defined data types. 

Given three cases :
1st case when two strings are given , print the smallest of the two strings.
2nd case when two integers are given, print the smallest of the two integers.
3rd case when two char are given , print the smallest of the two characters(lowercase).

Your task is to complete class minElement which would include a private variable say y, a constructor which would set the given value to the private variable. And a method check() which would take one parameter say x and print the min of x and y(private variable) .

First line of each input will contain 1 integer c. Next line will contain two strings if c is equal to 1 or will contain two integers if c is equal to 2 or will contain two char if value of c is equal to 3. We have to print the lowest of the two values given.

Example 1:

Input:
1
gfg spl
Output: 
gfg
Example 2:

Input:
2
5 9
Output: 
5

template <class T>
class minElement
{
    private:
       T a ;
       T b ;
       
   public:
      minElement(T n)
      {
          a=n;
      }
      
      void check(T m )
      {
          b=m;
         cout<< min(a,b)<<endl;
      }
    // Complete the class.Make a private variable,constructors and method called
    // check() which takes one parameter and prints the output in new line. 
};
