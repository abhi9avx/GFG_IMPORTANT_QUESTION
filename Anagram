Anagram 

...........................

Given two stringsaandbconsisting of lowercase characters. The task is to check whether two given strings are an anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, act and tac are an anagram of each other.

Example 1:

Input:a = geeksforgeeks, b = forgeeksgeeks
Output: YES
Explanation: Both the string have samecharacters with
        same frequency. So, both are anagrams.
Example 2:

Input:a = allergy, b = allergic
Output: NO
Explanation:Characters in both the strings are 
        not same, so they are not anagrams.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Yourtask is to complete the functionisAnagram() which takes the string a and string b as input parameterand checkif the two strings are an anagram of each other. The functionreturns trueif the strings are anagram else itreturns false.

Expected Time Complexity:O(|a|+|b|).
Expected Auxiliary Space:O(Number of distinct characters).

Note: |s| represents the length of string s.

Constraints:
1 ≤ |a|,|b| ≤ 105

 bool isAnagram(string a, string b)
    {
        
        // Your code here
        if(a.length() != b.length())
           return false;
       else{
           sort(a.begin(), a.end());
           sort(b.begin(), b.end());
           
           for(int i=0; i<a.length(); i++){
               if(a[i]!=b[i])
                   return false;
           }
       }
       
       return true;
        
    }
