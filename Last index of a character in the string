Last index of a character in the string

.....................

Given a string S  and a character X, the task is to find the last index (0 based indexing) of X in string S. If no index found then the answer will be -1.


Example 1:

Input: S = "Geeks", P = 'e'
Output: 2
Explanation: Last index of 'e' 
is 2.
Example 2:

Input: S = "okiyh", P = 'z'
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no character
as 'z'.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function LastIndex() which takes the string s and character p as inputs and returns the answer.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105
S and P contain only lower and upper case alphabets.

............

int LastIndex(string s, char p){
        //complete the function here
        int n = s.length();
       vector<int>positions;
       for(int i=0; i<n;i++){
           if(s[i] == p){
               positions.push_back(i);
           }
           else{
               positions.push_back(-1);
           }
       }
       return *max_element(positions.begin(), positions.end()); 
    }
};
