2. Front to Back

................................

Iterators are used to iterate over vectors, maps, sets etc. Here we will learn to iterate over a vector from begin to end.
You are given a vector V of size n. You need to print its elements.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
vector -> 1 2 3 4 5
Output: 
1 2 3 4 5
Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the function iter() that takes two iterators as parameters, i.e., starting and ending iterators. In a new line, print the required output.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 107
0 <= Vi <= 107

 
 
 ..................................
 
 void iter(vector<int>::iterator it1,vector<int>::iterator it2)
{
    //Your code here. Use iterator to print all the elements
    for(auto i = it1; i !=it2;i++)
    {
        cout<<*i<<" ";
    }
    cout<<endl;
}
