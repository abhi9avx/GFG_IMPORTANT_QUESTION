Maximize OR
.......................

Given a number X find the total numbers A such that A OR X > X,  and 1<=A<=X.

Example 1:

Input: X = 10
Output: 7 
Explanation: In the range [1,10] if the 
OR is taken of 10 and any number in the 
set {1,3,4,5,6,7,9} the resulting value 
will be greater than 10.
Example 2:

Input: X = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: In the range [1,5] if the
OR is taken of 5 and any number in the
set {2,3} the resulting value
will be greater than 5.

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function getCount() which takes X as input parameter and returns the the total count of the different value of A possible.

Expected Time Complexity: O(logn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1<= X <=108

..........................

public:
    int getCount(int X) {
        // code here
        return X-pow(2, __builtin_popcount(X))+1;
    }
    
};
