Common Divisors

.............

Given two integer numbers a and b, the task is to find count of all common divisors of given numbers.

Example 1:

Input: a = 12, b = 24
Output: 6 
Explanation: all common divisors 
are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12.

Example 2:

Input: a = 3, b = 17
Output: 1
Explanation: all common divisors are 1.

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function commDiv() which takes n as input parameter and returns the number of common divisors.

Expected Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1<= a,b <=1000

.................

long long int commDiv(long long int a,long long int b) {
        // code here
        long long int num=__gcd(a,b);
       int count=0;
       for(int i=1;i<=num;i++){
           if(num%i==0){
               count++;
           }
       }
       return count;
    }
};
