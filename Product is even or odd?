Product is even or odd? 

..........................
You are given two long numbers N1 and N2 in a string. You need to find out if the product of these numbers generate an even number or an odd number, If it is an even number print 1 else print 0.

Example 1:

Input: 
N1 = "12"
N2 = "15"
Output: 1
Explanation: 12 * 15 = 180 which is an 
even number.
â€‹Example 2:

Input: 
N1 = "123"
N2 = "457"
Output: 0
Explanation: 123*457 = 56211 which is an 
odd number.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function EvenOdd() which accepts two strings N1 and N2 as input parameter and returns 1 or 0 accordingly.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ N1, N2 ≤ 1099

 int EvenOdd(string n1 , string n2)
{
    //code here.
    int s1=n1.length();
   int s2=n2.length();
   int N1=0;
   int N2=0;
   for(int i=0;i<s1;i++){
       char ch=n1[i];
       N1=N1*10+(ch-'0');
   }
   for(int i=0;i<s2;i++){
       char ch=n2[i];
       N2=N2*10+(ch-'0');
   }
   int c=N1*N2;
   if(c%2==0){
       return 1;
       
   }
   else{
       return 0;
   }
}
