Pattern of Strings

......................

Given a string S of length N, find the pattern of the strings as shown below in the examples.

Example 1:

Input: S = "GeeK"
Output: Geek
        Gee
        Ge
        G
Explanation: Decrease one character 
after each line
â€‹Example 2:

Input: S = "G*g" 
Output: G*g
        G*
        G
Explanation: Decrease one character
after each line
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function pattern() which takes the string S as inputs and returns the answer as a list of strings.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N2)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 103

	vector<string> pattern(string S)
	{
	    // Your code goes here
	     vector<string>v;
        string str[1000]={""};
        int i,j;
        for(i=0;S[i]!='\0';i++){
            for(j=0;j<S.size()-i;j++){
                str[i].push_back(S[j]);
            }
            v.push_back(str[i]);
        }
        return v;
	}
