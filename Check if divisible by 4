Check if divisible by 4 

.........................

Given a number N. Check whether it is divisble by 4.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 1124
Output: 1
Explanation: The number is divisible by 4
as 1124 % 4 = 0.

â€‹Example 2:

Input: 
N = 7
Output: 0
Explanation: The number is not divisibly by
4 as 7 % 4 = 3.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function divisibleBy4() which takes the number in the form of a string N as input and returns 1 if the number is divisible by 4. Else, it returns 0.


Expected Time Complexity: O(1).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 101000+5

public:	
	
	int divisibleBy4 (string str)
	{
	    // Your Code Here
	    int n = str.length(), n1 = 0, n2 = 0;
	    
	    if(n > 1)
	        n1 = str[n-2]-'0';
	        
	    n2 = str[n-1]-'0';
	    
	    int N = n1*10 + n2;
	    
	    return !(N % 4);
	}
};
