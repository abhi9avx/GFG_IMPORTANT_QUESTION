Check if divisible by 11 

Given a number S. Check whether it is divisble by 11 or not.

Example 1:

Input:
S = 76945
Output: 1
Explanation: The number is divisible by 11
as 76945 % 11 = 0.

â€‹Example 2:

Input: 
S = 12
Output: 0
Explanation: The number is not divisible
by 11 as 12 % 11 = 1.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function divisibleBy11() which takes the number in the form of string S as input and returns 1 if the number is divisible by 11. Else, it returns 0.


Expected Time Complexity: O(Log S) where S is the input number.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1). 


Constraints:
1<=S<=101000+5

int divisibleBy11 (string S)

	    int sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0;
	    
	    for(int i = 0; i < S.length(); i++)
	    {
	        if(i%2 == 0)
	            sum1 += S[i]-'0';
	        else
	            sum2 += S[i]-'0';
	    }
	    
	    int N = sum1-sum2;
	    
	    return !(N % 11);
	}
