G.F Series 

....................

Siddhant made a special series and named it as G.F Series. The series follows this trend  Tn=(Tn-2)2-(Tn-1)  in which the first and the second term are 0 and 1 respectively. Help Siddhant to find up to N terms of the series.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
Output:
0 1 -1
Explanation:
First-term is given as 0 and the second 
term is 1. So the T3 = (T3-2)2 - (T3-1) 
= T12 - T2 = 02 - 1 = -1
Example 2:

Input:
N = 6
Output:
0 1 -1 2 -1 5  
Explanation:
first term : 0
second term : 1
third term : -1
fourth term = (1)2 - (-1) = 2
fifth term = (-1)2 - (2) = 1 - 2 = -1
sixth term = (2)2 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5 
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input. Your task is to complete the function gfSeries() which takes an integer N as an input parameter and print first N term of the series.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 15
