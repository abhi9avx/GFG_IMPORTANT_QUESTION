There are N students in a class. Each student got arr[i] (1 <= i <= N) marks in mathematics exam. Geek loves mathematics and he got X marks. Now geek is curious to know, how many students in his class got marks greater than that of Geek's.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases is as follows:

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and X.
The second line contains N space-separated positive integers representing array arr[ ].

Output Format:
In a new line, for each test case, print the count of students who got marks greater than X.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= arr[i], K <= 100000

Example:

Sample Input:
2
3 2
4 1 3
4 9
4 8 1 2

Sample Output:
2
0

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Students with marks 4 and 3 
got higher marks than Geek who got 2 marks
